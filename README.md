# txt
A very small and probably very broken text editor written in Python3

## How to use

1. get the files onto your computer (download, clone, etc.)
2. add `alias txt="python /full/path/to/python/file/main.py"`
3. you are all set!
4. use `txt file.stuff` to open/create files

## Required stuff

1. Python3
2. python `prompt_toolkit`
3. computer (linux)
4. also I think `pygments` for python but maybe not idk I made this a while ago and it's probably not gonna work
